# New Venture(s) Compass

## Team Reflection
This document lists feedback and details on the progress for our New Venture(s) Compass app for Milestone 2.

## Background
The default view provides information on 10 randomly selected countries from the World bank database on different indicators and areas one need to gain knowledge on to start a new business in a country.
The app has three different tabs for different functions – 1. Main: This gives brief recommendation on countries suitable for new ventures as per user’s expectations with respect to the cost for starting business and time required for starting business. 2. Resources: This page gives detailed information regarding financial instruments and labor resource status for the countries selected in Main page. 3. Logistics: This page gives detailed information regarding status of imports, exports and overall logistics picture for the countries selected in Main page. 
A dropdown menu which allows multiple selection provides ability for users to further narrow down selection to a few years or for specific countries or specific gender. Users can compare macro environment and economic statuses of different countries by navigating through different pages. 

Final goal is that these provide information for user to be able to select the exact country or countries for new ventures and investments that fulfills their interest.

## Development and Implementation - Progress till date 
a. Implemented basic framework in Python across three tabs.
b. Default view with user training information is available.
c. Individual graphs are implemented and all main concepts tested.

### Development and Implementation - The road ahead
a. Implement slider integrations across tabs. Currently only one of the slides (Cost to select) is implemented but is not integrated.
b. Separate histogram for unemployment chart.
c. Legend based interactive selections need to be implemented fully, Currently implemented for two charts.
d. Arrange figures with right sizes and provide consistency across charts, Currently this is partially implemented.
e. Fine tune default view for selection across tabs and various input selection(consistency).
f. Add data source on dashboard.
g. Restrict inputs to 10 countries (nice to have).

### Dashboard Advantages
a. There is text embedded above each tab which gives the reader a sense of what they are looking for and why its necessary. 
This story telling approach will guide user interactively and with rationale to select countries.

b. Dashboard has a default view with 10 countries, this makes anyone get quickly familiar with what the dashboard can deliver in an intuitive way. There is no such application that exists today that we know of.
 
## Dashboard Limitations
a. Data is available only till 2019, new data will be available only in 2024. Till then, history is limited for decision.
b. Some data is not available in the database, graph would report NA.
c. Include more parameters.

## Dashboard Open Issues
Please refer to the GitHub issues list and road ahead section.

We hope, one can appreciate the purpose and the functions built and imagined so far of the app.

We discuss the motivation, purpose and perceived user experience and benefits of New Venture(s) Compass dashboard in this document.

We also briefly introduce the dataset used for the dashboard.

## Motivation and purpose:

Our role: Data scientist consultancy and business advisory firm
Target audience: Entrepreneurs who want to start a new global business
This is an era of global economy and good hearts who want to bridge the gap in development between countries. Entrepreneurs are interested in creating new initiatives/ventures and contribute to global economy including developing countries. There are several unknowns in starting a business in a country and the requirements vary by country. This is a risk to any business as they are threat to success and risk to countries as well who could potentially miss new opportunities.
Our app is intended to help entrepreneurs select countries suitable for their needs and go more informed into these countries. Our app indirectly helps different countries as they can benefit from new opportunities. In these ways, our app reduces risk of failure for businesses and helps countries benefit from new opportunities.
